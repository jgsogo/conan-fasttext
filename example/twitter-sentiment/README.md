This is a copy of this [repo by @kirkshoop](https://github.com/kirkshoop/twitter), trying to
understand every line of code and write it again _in my own words_. I may add something original,
but I strongly recommend you to read and understand the original sources first (also, read
the blog where you can find [associated posts](http://kirkshoop.github.io/2016/12/05/calling_the_twitter_stream_api.html)).
